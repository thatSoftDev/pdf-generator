# Website to PDF generator

This is a script that converts every website's page into pdfs. I had the idea to build this when I had to go on a flight (offline) and wanted to read some docs.

## Installation

Clone the project and run the following commands to install it:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the script:

```bash
node scrapper.js --url={url}
```

**Note:** You can find the generated pdfs in the pdfs directory.
